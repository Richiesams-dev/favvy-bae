    Really (ah), do you ever think about me?
Really, if you're honest with me
I'd like to say it's two-way (ah)
Do you ever think about me?
Really, if you're honest with me
I'd like to say it's two-way (hmm)
(Makers)
Who else you thinkin' 'bout?
I can't be callin' your phone every day
Fuck is you thinkin' 'bout
This shit ain't loyal, then it's gonna spoil your heart, like the trash, you can take it out
Quit makin' up shit to complain about, she lay on the couch, I'm all in her crotch
We fuck, then we break up, we fuck, then we make up, we fuck, then we break up and make up
We fucked in Jamaica, we fucked at Bojangle, we fucked in the back of Bottega
I ordered the check up, I'm over the radar, now you chasing that pussy, not paper
I slow it all down with the maple, you know I got too many flavors
And she fell in love with her neighbor
If I hit it once, then I hit it again
Face and her body a ten, hair blowin' in the wind
Stoppin' in town and I beat that shit down, and I'm back on the road again
She come on the low with her friends
She know I got hoes like I'm Prince
They printed, I get it, I got every penny, you know I got plenty of Benji's
Fuck in that new condominium, we on the balcony, we looking over the city
She know she gotta come drip to get just like a bachelor, we never showin' no pity
You got a business then I gotta be the ambassador, we got it started in Philly
Who else you thinkin' 'bout?
I can't be callin' your phone every day
Fuck is you thinkin' 'bout
This shit ain't loyal, then it's gonna spoil your heart, like the trash, you can take it out
Quit makin' up shit to complain about, she lay on the couch, I'm all in her crotch
We fuck, then we break up, we fuck, then we make up, we fuck, then we break up and make up
We fucked in Jamaica, we fucked at Bojangle, we fucked in the back of Bottega
I ordered the check, up I'm over the radar, you chasing that pussy, not paper
I slow it all down with the maple, you know I got too many flavors
Young Gunna got too many flavors, they all sittin' pretty with white on they toes
High-end designer the clothes, ridin' back of the Rolls
That my lil' yat, I love fuckin' her face (yeah)
When it come to that throat, she G.O.A.T. (she G.O.A.T.)
She swallowin' all of it, she don't choke
I'm pullin' up on her for sure (for sure)
I peep that she want it, ain't give me no warnin', we all gon' fuck if she horny
Had a few shots and I took her right back to the spot and I gave her the dick 'til the mornin'
She like a shirt, I been flippin' her inside and out, our sex'll never get borin' (get borin')
She said she think about me every time I leave out, she need to keep on recording
Who else you thinkin' 'bout?
I can't be callin' your phone every day
Fuck is you thinkin' 'bout
This shit ain't loyal, then it's gonna spoil your heart, like the trash, you can take it out
Quit makin' up shit to complain about, she lay on the couch, I'm all in her crotch
We fuck, then we break up, we fuck, then we make up, we fuck, then we break up and make up
We fucked in Jamaica, we fucked at Bojangle, we fucked in the back of Bottega
I ordered the check, up I'm over the radar, you chasing that pussy, not paper
I slow it all down with the maple, you know I got too many flavors
Really (ah), do you ever think about me?
Really, if you're honest with me
I'd like to say it's two-way
(Ah) do you ever think about me?
Really, if you're honest with me
I'd like to say it's two-way
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
